    <p>Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels.

        This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this increases levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine.
        
        One small study found that consuming caffeine increased time to exhaustion during a cycling exercise by 12% and significantly reduced subjective levels of fatigue in participants.
        
        Another study had similar findings, reporting that consuming caffeine before and during a round of golf improved performance, increased subjective energy levels, and reduced feelings of fatigue.</p>

    <p>Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several different processes to remove almost all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans.</p>

    
    <h3>Black Coffee</h3>

    <p>No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans that are brewed hot. It's served without added sugar, milk, or flavorings.</p>

    <h3>Espresso Coffee</h3>

    <p>Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's the difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans themselves, but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more concentrated liquid with a bolder flavor. A single espresso is a one-ounce shot. It's also the base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.</p>
